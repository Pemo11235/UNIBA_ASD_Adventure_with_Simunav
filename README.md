# UNIBA_ASD_Adventure_with_Simunav
"Adventure with Simunav" is a text-based adventure game in which the player controls the commander of the spaceship "Neutronia", who after waking up with a start in his cockpit, due to a high temperature, must move to the inside the spaceship by solving problems / puzzles to save himself and his crew.

It is requested to modify the basic project (base1911 - Rosa C.) so that the features present in that of Michele S. are added, specifically, the inclusion of a backpack and a suitcase. Furthermore, it is envisaged that the realization of at least two data structures are made interchangeable.

The functionalities to be implemented in the basic project are:
The insertion of objects, a backpack or a suitcase, i.e. containers that allow the user to carry certain objects (such as helmet, overalls, gown or manual). You can also decide whether to take these items with you or put them in your suitcase or backpack.
The backpack and suitcase have transportable weight limits. The position of these two containers will be fixed: with each new game they will always be in the same place, with the possibility of choosing whether to use them or not. It will not be possible to transport both
container objects, only one of the two must be chosen.
In the suitcase you can insert and withdraw as many objects as you want, remaining within the limits of the maximum weight allowed, while in the backpack you can put as many objects as you want while remaining within the weight limits, but you can only take the first of these.
This means that, in case you want to explore the whole backpack, you will have to remove all the objects present. The use of the backpack or suitcase is at the discretion of the adventurer who, if he has one, can decide whether to carry the objects with him or put them in the container.
